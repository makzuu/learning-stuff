sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: if the numbers are sorted it always ends faster because it only have to go through
the numbers 1 time.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: if the numbers are not sorted always ends faster meaning that the algorithm is 
faster.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: when the numbers are not sorted ends faster that the bubble sort but when the 
numbers are sorted, it ends slower than the bubble sort because, though the numbers are sorted the 
selection sort does'nt know it until it proves that.
